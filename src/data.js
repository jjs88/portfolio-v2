<p>Hi, I'm Josh <span class="em-svg em-wave"></span></p>

   I am a front end developer in training. My background is in databases as a developer with sql server. This is my portfolio which will contain the projects 
   I have worked on at Bov Academy as well as other projects I have done in my spare time. When I'm not heads down in code
   I enjoy going for bike rides, working out, and going on road trips. I also really love the NBA and I'm a fan of everything basketball.
